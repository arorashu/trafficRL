PROBLEMS:

* SUMO lane length approximation for state representation
		- re-consider when increasing no. of intersections

* Effect of min. green time
		- if min green time = 10 and step = 5, one step of computation will be useless
		- update of variables at the end of this step will also be wrong. especially, action updates
		- will also increase size of DB as new state will be created that needn't be analyzed and added to DB

	POSSIBLE SOLUTION: 	If time in curr phase (2nd entry in state vector) is less than min. green time, then let process sleep.
						sleep before adding to DB (if at all it doesn't exist)

* Effect of yellow phase time
		- what will be state if queried at this time
		- effect of RL computations at this time

	POSSIBLE SOLUTION:	Set yellow time and step so as to avoid this

* Making alpha i.e. learning rate variable
		- done in paper
	POSSINLE SOLUTION:	Keep count of visits to pair (s,a) in DB


IMPROVEMENTS:

* Consider emergency vehicles

* Consider 3 roads intersections
		- present in real world
		- will be present when importing map from OSM
